# Real-Time Data Analysis

## What and Why I am building this project?

I am building a real-time sales data analysis Application using Spark Structured Streaming, Kafka as messaging system, MongoDB as a raw data storage for backup and analytic purposes using machine learning, MySQL as a storage for processed data and Superset for creating dashboard.

The goal of this project is to find out whether having a real-time sales data analysis application will be a solution to solve the problems facing at Mya Gon Yaung, Men’s traditional clothing retail shop where I am working at.

## Problem facing at the shop

The shop manually records everything in a book and didn’t use digital recording. Since sales are only written in a book, it is easy to find daily sales but difficult to know monthly or yearly sales. So, we don’t know our monthly and yearly sales, what products are sold most in which month and which stocks needs to be refill and which don’t?  As we don’t know the answers to these questions, we often over stock or under stock many products which greatly affect our profits.

## Task:

Find out if I can get answers to these questions using a real-time data analysis system:
